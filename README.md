# Permafrost ❄️

**Win+V-style clipboard history for macOS — pin forever, expire the rest.**

Permafrost brings the Windows clipboard manager experience (`Win + V`) to macOS, with the
retention model Windows never had: **pinned entries are permanently frozen; unpinned entries
thaw and expire** after a period you choose.

Local-first. Keyboard-first. No cloud, no analytics, no network code at all.

## Features

- **Clipboard history** — text, rich text, and images (including screen snips via ⌃⇧⌘4)
- **One hotkey** — `⌥⌘V` opens the panel over whatever you're doing; `Esc` dismisses it
- **Pinning** — pinned entries never expire, live in their own section, and never steal a
  quick-paste slot from your latest copy
- **Time-based retention** — unpinned entries expire automatically (1/7/30/90 days, or never)
- **Search** — type to filter instantly (SQLite FTS5 under the hood)
- **Paste on select** — `⏎` pastes straight into the app you were using
- **Mouse-friendly too** — hover any entry for pin / share / delete buttons
- **Menu bar app** — no Dock icon, no window clutter
- **Pause capture** — temporarily stop recording from the menu bar or Settings
- **Import / export** — your history is yours; take it with you

## Windows → macOS cheat sheet

| Windows | Permafrost / macOS |
|---|---|
| `Win + V` (clipboard history) | `⌥⌘V` |
| `Win + Shift + S` (screen snip → clipboard) | `⌃⇧⌘4` (built into macOS; Permafrost keeps the snip) |
| Pin item in Win+V | `⌥P` on the selected item |
| Paste from history | `⏎` or `⌘1`–`⌘9` |

## Install

Permafrost is currently built from source (signed/notarized downloads are on the
[roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md)).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Fuzzy-Logic-Yetis/permafrost.git
cd permafrost
./scripts/make-app.sh          # builds release binary and assembles Permafrost.app
open dist/Permafrost.app
```

Requires macOS 14+ and the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

On first paste, macOS will ask you to grant **Accessibility** permission
(System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility). This is required to
simulate `⌘V` into the frontmost app. Without it, Permafrost still works in
copy-to-clipboard mode.

## Privacy

- Everything is stored in a local SQLite database:
  `~/Library/Application Support/Permafrost/` (owner-only file permissions)
- Content copied from password managers (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.) is **not recorded by
  default** — Permafrost honors `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType` and transient pasteboard
  types. If you *want* password history, there's an explicit opt-in behind a
  risk-acknowledgment prompt (see [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md))
- **Excluded apps** — add any app to Settings → Excluded Apps and Permafrost never records
  anything copied while that app is frontmost, useful for apps that don't mark their
  clipboard content as concealed
- There is no network code in this application. None. Verify it — the source is right here.

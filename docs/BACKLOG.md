# Engineering Backlog

Ordered. Items are promoted to GitHub issues when about to be worked. Product-scale ideas
live in [FUTURE_IDEAS.md](FUTURE_IDEAS.md); this file is engineering work.

## Next up (v0.3)

1. ~~Custom hotkey recorder~~ — **DONE 2026-07-07.** Built natively with an AppKit-backed
   recorder in Settings; no dependency added. Existing presets/defaults remain, while a
   recorded custom shortcut is stored in UserDefaults (`customHotkeyKeyCode` +
   `customHotkeyModifiers`) and takes precedence until the user returns to a preset or
   resets to `⌥⌘V`.
2. ~~App icon~~ — **DONE 2026-07-07.** Icy-blue gradient squircle with a bold white
   snowflake glyph, generated via `scripts/generate-icon.swift` (CoreGraphics/AppKit,
   exports all 10 `.iconset` sizes, converted with `iconutil`). Wired into
   `scripts/make-app.sh` (`CFBundleIconFile` in `Info.plist`); `.icns` committed as a
   binary resource, not regenerated per build.
3. ~~Pause capture~~ — **DONE 2026-07-07.** Status-item menu toggle (mirrored in
   Settings → General) persists `capturePaused`; while paused, pasteboard changes advance
   the watcher checkpoint but are not saved, so skipped items are not backfilled on resume.
4. ~~Per-app exclusion list~~ — **DONE 2026-07-07.** Settings → Excluded Apps lets you add
   any installed app via an Open panel; Permafrost matches on bundle identifier (stable
   across renames, unlike the display name) and skips capture entirely — before the
   concealed-type check, before touching the pasteboard payload — whenever that app is
   frontmost. Excluded apps are stored as JSON in UserDefaults (`AppSettings.excludedApps`),
   consistent with the existing settings pattern.
5. **Background inserts for large images** — move image writes off the main actor if
   Instruments shows panel jank (see ARCHITECTURE.md → Concurrency).
6. ~~Preview pane~~ — **DONE 2026-07-07.** `␣` (search field empty) toggles a Quick
   Look-style overlay of the selected item's full text (unwrapped, scrollable, selectable)
   or full-resolution image, reusing the panel's existing 440×500 footprint. Follows
   selection while open; `Esc` closes it before falling back to its existing
   clear-search/close-panel behavior. Deferred: a hover/mouse trigger for the preview — the
   hover row (pin/share/delete) is already at a natural width for three icons, and a fourth
   felt like it'd crowd it more than it'd help, so this stayed keyboard-only for now.
7. ~~Monospace-aware text rendering~~ — **DONE 2026-07-07.** Code-like text
   clips are detected in the panel and rendered with a monospaced font plus subtle
   leading/trailing whitespace markers.
8. ~~UI-layer automated tests~~ — **DONE 2026-07-07.** Added a lightweight
   `PermafrostTests` target that imports the app module and tests `PanelModel` with an
   in-memory store plus fake paste service. Covered show/search resets, selection clamping,
   quick-paste recent-only bounds, commit callback ordering/accessibility fallback,
   pinning, and delete selection bounds. Screenshot/UI automation remains deliberately
   out of scope; hover action wiring stays in the manual checklist.
9. ~~Confirm status item icon visibility~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-07-07, see ADR-015.** Root
   cause: the menu bar had too many items competing for space; macOS silently drops status
   items that don't fit, with no overflow indicator. Not a Permafrost bug — freeing space
   (project owner disabled Siri and Spotlight in System Settings → Menu Bar) fixed it
   immediately and reliably. No code change needed. This also explains the ADR-013/014
   flakiness (which other transient icons were present varied per launch) and retroactively
   invalidates the ADR-014 "ghost item" accessibility-position diagnostic — a live
   screenshot proved the icon was genuinely visible while that query still reported bogus
   data, so that signal was never meaningful in the first place.

10. **Hotkey registration failure/rollback test coverage** — `HotkeyManager.register`
    (Sources/Permafrost/HotkeyManager.swift) now returns a success `Bool` (ADR-017, review
    M-1), but Carbon's `RegisterEventHotKey` isn't practical to fail deterministically in a
    unit test (would need to first claim a shortcut in a separate process). Cover with the
    manual checklist for now (docs/TESTING.md); revisit if Carbon exposes a way to simulate
    failure, or extract the success/failure branch behind a seam that can be faked.
11. **Preview-mode keyboard-routing tests** — `PanelController.handle` lets paste/delete/
    pin/quick-paste act on the previewed item while the overlay is open (documented in
    docs/UX.md, review L-1). `PanelModel` already has app-target test coverage
    (docs/BACKLOG.md item 8); extend it to assert those actions still resolve to the
    correct item while `isPreviewShown` is true.
12. **Testable policy object for pasteboard watcher pause/excluded-app behavior** — review
    L-1/testing-assessment note: `PasteboardWatcher`'s pause-capture and excluded-app skip
    logic (Sources/Permafrost/PasteboardWatcher.swift) currently lives inline against
    `NSWorkspace`/`AppSettings` and isn't unit tested. Extract the "should this capture be
    skipped right now" decision behind a small protocol so it can be tested the way
    `PanelPasteServing` let `PanelModel` be tested without AppKit.

## Later

- **Optional at-rest encryption** — CryptoKit AES-GCM blobs, key in Keychain (ADR-008 has
  the constraint analysis; FUTURE_IDEAS.md has the design sketch).
- **Sparkle auto-updates** — only meaningful once Developer ID signing exists (v1.0).
- **Homebrew cask** — requires notarized artifact (v1.0).
- **Drag-and-drop out of the panel** — drag an item card into a document.
- **Paste as plain text** modifier (⇧⏎) — strip rich data on paste.
- **Localization scaffolding** — English-only for MVP.
- **`swift format` lint gate in CI** — currently advisory, make it enforced.

## Deliberately rejected (see ADRs / non-goals)

- Mac App Store distribution (ADR-007)
- Cloud sync (CLAUDE.md non-goals)
- Sandboxing (ADR-007)
